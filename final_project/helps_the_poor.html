<h1 style="text-align: center;">HOW RECYLING HELPS THE POOR?</h1>
<p> Recyling helps the poor in many ways. My goal in this project was to do to things clean the communtiy and help the poor. I already explain how to clean up the community by recyling next I have to explain how I can help the poor.</p>

<p> What people don't know is when you put a recyled object in the machine they give you 5 cent so the 5 cent keeps adding up. So to get $1 you need to recyle 20 plastic bottles. This goes for glass bottles and cans. Every ounce of recyling counts. With this we can give money to the poor and still help the community.</p>
