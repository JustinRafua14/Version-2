<h2> Why do we need to recyle? Why its because it saves the world. Recyling means using something over and over again. Different materials are renewable resources meaning they can be used over again. Plastic, glasss, paper,and aluminium. There are also things that are non-renewable. Oil, gas, and coal are non-renewable resources because once their gone they can be brought back. I'm not saying we can never have it again I am saying it takes thousands of years to form again. Recyling gives us a better a chance of presering our non-renewable by using materials that can be reused again.</h2>
